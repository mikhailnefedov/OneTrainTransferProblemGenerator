# OneTrainTransferProblemGenerator

Hello! You may stumble upon this project because of certain reasons (as of July 2023). Just a quick short summary and some impressions:

- Project is part of my thesis
- Goal: Generating instances for the one train transfer problem with controllable properties or rather controllable generators
- Look at algorithms to solve these problems with potential heuristics or through evolutionary algorithms (less or no ILP)
- Make these results presentable (e.g. visualizations)

For the visualization and to better understand the diversity of the generated instances I use:
> K. Smith-Miles, M.A. Mu√±oz and Neelofar. *Melbourne Algorithm Test Instance Library with Data Analytics (MATILDA)*. Available at (https://matilda.unimelb.edu.au). 2020.


Here are some impressions of the current instance space:
